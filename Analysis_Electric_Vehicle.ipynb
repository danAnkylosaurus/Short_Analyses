Since electric vehicles were invented, although their popularity had ebb and flow they lasted until today. As the times changed, there is a growing demand for electric vehicles today.</p>\n",

In the 2020s, we can see the different trends of the Electric Vehicle Types, where PHEVs have less growth of registered vehicle models than BEVs over years.
